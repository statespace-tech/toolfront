# FAQ

**When should I use the Python SDK vs MCP Server?**

Use the Python SDK to run applications directly with built-in agents. Use the MCP Server to connect your own agents (like Claude Desktop or Cline) to applications.

**Can I use ToolFront with any AI model?**

Yes! The Python SDK works with any model through **[Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/models/overview/)**, including cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral) and local models (Ollama, LM Studio).

**How do I deploy applications?**

You can run applications locally, deploy them to the community or private cloud, or host them on your own infrastructure.
